      present and future. There are also three English tenses - present, past and
      future, but depending on whether the action is complete or continuous, each
      of these tenses can be of four types - simple, continuous, perfect and perfect
      continuous. As a result, there are 12 tense forms in English.

      complex rules of grammar and have a large number of forms.'

      Passive
      voice shows that the person or thing expressed by the subject experiences the
      action on itself:

      The passive voice is used when the doer of an action
      is obvious or insignificant, or when the action or its result is more interesting
      than the doer.

      Formation of the passive voice

      In order to obtain
      a verb form in the passive voice, you need the auxiliary verb to be in the
      appropriate tense, person and number and the past participle (Participle II)
      of the significant verb

      after the auxiliary verb, and if there are several of them, then after the
      first of them'
